% --- Tutorial for Using Abbreviations ---
% \chapter{Using Abbreviations in LaTeX}
% \label{chap:abbreviation-tutorial}
% To define abbreviations, use the \texttt{\string\newacronym} command in the preamble:
% \begin{verbatim}
% \newacronym{ai}{AI}{Artificial Intelligence}
% \end{verbatim}

% To reference an abbreviation in the text, use the \texttt{\string\gls} command:
% \begin{verbatim}
% Artificial Intelligence (\gls{ai})
% \end{verbatim}

% The first occurrence will display the full form, while subsequent occurrences will show only the abbreviation.

% DOCUMENT MANAGEMENT TIPS
%==============================================================================
% - Use \label{} and \ref{} for cross-referencing sections, figures, and tables
% - ALWAYS reference every figure and table in the text before it appears
% - Keep your images in the 'images/' directory and reference them with \includegraphics
% - Run LaTeX twice to ensure all references and citations are properly linked
% - Use the hyperref package (already included) for clickable links in PDF output
% - For large documents, consider using \include{filename} to split content into multiple files
% - Use consistent formatting throughout your document
% - Proofread carefully for spelling and grammatical errors
% - Check all equations for mathematical correctness
% - Ensure all citations in the text have corresponding entries in the bibliography
