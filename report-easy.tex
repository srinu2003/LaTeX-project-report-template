%------------------------------------------------------------------------------
% The main content of your document
\begin{spacing}{1.5}

    % --- Main Content ---
    \chapter{Introduction}
    \label{chap:introduction}

    The introduction should provide background information on your topic, explain the significance of your research, and clearly state your research question or objective. This chapter should also outline the structure of the document and briefly summarize each subsequent chapter.

    Times New Roman font is used for the text in this document, and the font size is set to 12pt. The line spacing is set to 1.5 for better readability.

    \section{Background}
    This section should provide context for your research, explaining fundamental concepts necessary for understanding your work.
    % Artificial Intelligence (\gls{ai}) is a rapidly growing field. Subfields such as \gls{ml} and \gls{nlp} are gaining significant attention.

    \section{Motivation}
    Explain why your research topic is important and what gap in knowledge it addresses.

    \section{Problem Statement}
    Clearly articulate the specific problem or question your research aims to address.

    \section{Outline of the Report}
    Provide a brief overview of the structure of your document, summarizing the content of each chapter.

    % CHAPTER 2: LITERATURE REVIEW
    \chapter{Literature Review}
    This chapter should synthesize existing research relevant to your topic. Analyze the current state of knowledge, identify gaps, and position your research within the existing literature.

    \section{Overview of Existing Work}
    Summarize key research papers, books, and other sources related to your topic.

    \section{Current Trends}
    Discuss recent developments and emerging trends in your research area.

    \section{Research Gaps}

    % --- Theoretical Framework ---
    % CHAPTER 3: THEORETICAL FRAMEWORK
    \chapter{Theoretical Framework}
    Present the theoretical foundation of your research, including relevant models, equations, algorithms, or principles.

    \section{Key Concepts}
    Define and explain the fundamental concepts central to your research.

    \section{Mathematical Formulation}
    Present any relevant mathematical formulations, theorems, or proofs.

    \section{Algorithms}
    This section presents the algorithms used in this research.

    % Example of how to include an algorithm with proper referencing
    Algorithm \ref{alg:example} demonstrates a basic search algorithm. This example shows how to properly format and include algorithms in your document.

    \begin{algorithm}
        \caption{Binary Search Algorithm}
        \label{alg:example}
        \begin{algorithmic}[1]
            \Procedure{BinarySearch}{$A, n, x$}
            \State $low \gets 1$
            \State $high \gets n$
            \While{$low \leq high$}
            \State $mid \gets low + \lfloor (high - low) / 2 \rfloor$ \Comment{Avoid integer overflow}
            \If{$A[mid] < x$}
            \State $low \gets mid + 1$
            \ElsIf{$A[mid] > x$}
            \State $high \gets mid - 1$
            \Else
            \State \Return $mid$
            \EndIf
            \EndWhile
            \State \Return $-1$
            \EndProcedure
        \end{algorithmic}
    \end{algorithm}

    \subsection{Algorithm Complexity Analysis}
    When analyzing the time complexity of Algorithm \ref{alg:example}, we find that binary search operates in $O(\log n)$ time, where $n$ is the number of elements in the sorted array. This is because each comparison eliminates approximately half of the remaining elements.

    \subsection{Pseudocode Formatting Tips}
    When writing algorithms:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Use consistent indentation
        \item Number each line for easy reference with \texttt{algorithmic[1]}
        \item Include proper comments for complex steps
        \item Clearly define inputs and outputs of procedures
    \end{itemize}

    % IMPORTANT: Always reference every figure in the text BEFORE it appears
    Figure \ref{fig:external_image} illustrates a key concept of this research. As shown in the figure, important relationships between variables can be visualized.
    As shown in Figure \ref{fig:tikz_figure}, the following diagram illustrates the relationship between key variables.

    % Example of adding a referenced figure
    \begin{figure}[H]
        \centering
        \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{example-image.jpg} % Replace 'sample-figure.jpg' with your image file name
        \caption[Short caption for sample figure]{Detailed caption explaining the sample figure. The short caption appears in the list of figures.}
        \label{fig:external_image}
    \end{figure}

    % Example of drawing a figure using TikZ
    \begin{figure}[H]
        \centering
        \begin{tikzpicture}
            % Example TikZ drawing: A simple triangle
            \draw[thick, blue] (0,0) -- (4,0) -- (2,3) -- cycle;
            \node at (2,-0.5) {Base};
            \node at (2,1.5) {Height};
        \end{tikzpicture}
        \caption[Short caption for TikZ figure]{Detailed caption explaining the TikZ-drawn figure. The short caption appears in the list of figures.}
        \label{fig:tikz_figure}
    \end{figure}

    % IMPORTANT: Every figure must be referenced in the text (e.g., "As shown in Figure \ref{fig:label}...")

    \section{Example Implementation}
    Listing \ref{lst:python_example} demonstrates a Python function implementation that doubles its input parameter. This code sample illustrates how to include formatted code in your document with syntax highlighting.

    \begin{lstlisting}[language=Python, caption=Example Python Code, breaklines=true, label=lst:python_example]
def example_function(parameter):
    """
    This is a sample function to demonstrate code inclusion. It takes a parameter and returns its double.
    :param parameter: The input value to be doubled.
    """
    result = parameter * 2
    return result

# Example usage
value = 42
print(f"The result is: {example_function(value)}")
    \end{lstlisting}
    The following code example demonstrates how to include code in your document using the \texttt{minted} package. This package provides syntax highlighting for various programming languages. Refer to Listing \ref{lst:python_example_minted} for an example of Python code included using the \texttt{minted} package.
    % Example of including code using minted
    \begin{listing}[H]
        \begin{minted}{py}
def example_function(parameter):
    """
    This is a sample function to demonstrate code inclusion. It takes a parameter and returns its double.
    :param parameter: The input value to be doubled.
    """
    result = parameter * 2
    return result
        \end{minted}
        \caption{Sample Python Code}
        \label{lst:python_example_minted}
    \end{listing}


    You can just write the code in the text without listing in document, this do not use listing, just write the code in the text. This is useful for small code snippets or examples that do not require a full listing format. For example, you can write a simple function in JavaScript like this:
    \begin{minted}{javascript}
function calculateFactorial(n) {
    // Base case: factorial of 0 or 1 is 1
    if (n === 0 || n === 1) {
        return 1;
    }

    // Recursive case: n * factorial of (n - 1)
    return n * calculateFactorial(n - 1);
}

// Example usage of the calculateFactorial function
const number = 5; // Number to calculate the factorial of
const factorial = calculateFactorial(number); // Perform the calculation

// Output the result
console.log(`The factorial of ${number} is ${factorial}`);
    \end{minted}

    \subsection{Example Equations}
    Below are sample equations formatted in LaTeX:

    % Inline equation example
    The quadratic formula $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$ has the solution $x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$.

    % Display equation example
    \begin{equation}
        E = mc^2
    \end{equation}

    % Equation array example
    \begin{align}
        (a+b)^2 & = a^2 + 2ab + b^2 \\
        (a-b)^2 & = a^2 - 2ab + b^2
    \end{align}
